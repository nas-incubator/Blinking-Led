This project demonstrates how to blink an LED connected to pin 2 of an Arduino board. It's a simple introductory project to get started with Arduino programming.

*Components Required
  Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
  LED
  Resistor (220 ohms)
  Jumper wires
  
*Connections
Connect the pin 2 of Arduino Board to the any of the pin in your 8-Bit Led Module 
Connect the GND of Arduino with GND of 8-Bit LED Module

*Instructions
Set up the circuit according to the circuit diagram.
Upload the provided Arduino sketch (led_blinking.ino) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any other suitable IDE.
The LED connected to pin 2 should start blinking at a 1-second interval.
