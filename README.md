This project demonstrates how to blink an LED connected to pin 2 of an Arduino board. It's a simple introductory project to get started with Arduino programming.

*Components Required
  Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
  LED
  Resistor (220 ohms)
  Jumper wires
  
*Connections
Connect the pin 2 of Arduino Board to the any of the pin in your 8-Bit Led Module 
Connect the GND of Arduino with GND of 8-Bit LED Module

*Instructions
Set up the circuit according to the connections above.
Upload the provided Arduino sketch (led_blinking.ino) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any other suitable IDE.
The LED connected to pin 2 should start blinking at a 1-second interval.

*Uploading the Code
  1. Connect your Arduino: Use the USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
  2. Select your board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino board. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the correct port for your Arduino.
  3. Upload the code: Click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

*Usage
  Once the code is uploaded, pin 2 of the 8-bit LED module should start blinking as described in the loop function. The LED will light up in sequence with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each step.

*Contributing
